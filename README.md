# go-commuter

A set of tools around an interface that deals with commutative operations. go-commuter eventually hopes to allow the use of commutative operations with data to greatly speed up the creation of data structures that are built through commutative operations on data (e.g: counters, bank balances) by implementing and encouraging the implementation of parallelizing primatives.
